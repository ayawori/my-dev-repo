[Enterprise Opportunities to Apply Reinforcement Learning & AI](https://www.teradata.com/Blogs/Enterprise-Opportunities-Reinforcement-Learning-AI)

To date there have been very few examples of applying reinforcement learning to enterprise problems like reducing the cost of fraud, recommending the best offer, or optimizing a supply chain.

Teradata Emerging Practices is developing approaches to apply reinforcement learning to these types of enterprise problems, for example, using off policy learning to overcome the challenge of not having a real-world environment to train the model like you would a robot in a lab. We are currently working with customers to demonstrate how reinforcement learning can be used to deliver enormous business value.
