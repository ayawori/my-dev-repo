[Reinforcement Learning Vs. Deep Reinforcement Learning: What’s the Difference?](https://www.techopedia.com/reinforcement-learning-vs-deep-reinforcement-learning-whats-the-difference/2/34039)

Deep reinforcement learning estimating state values with function approximation.

Function approximation enables the agent to generalize the value of states, or has partial information about, by using the values of similar states.

>"Much of the exciting advancements in deep reinforcement learning have come about because of the strong ability of neural networks to generalize across enormous state spaces."

determining the next best action to engage with a customer:
>"The state and actions could include all the combinations of products, offers and messaging across all the different channels, with each message being personalized - wording, images, colors, fonts.”

delivering perishable products:
>“The possible states include the current location of all the different types of transportation, the inventory in all the plants, warehouses and retail outlets, and the demand forecast for all the stores,”
