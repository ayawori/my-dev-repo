[How Reinforcement Learning is Changing Customer Engagement](https://www.teradata.com/Blogs/How-Reinforcement-Learning-is-Changing-Customer-Engagement) - (September 03 2019)

With reinforcement learning, models are trained to take actions in an environment so as to maximize a reward; not every action results in a positive reward, but the goal is that over time the sequence of actions will maximize the possible total reward. For this reason, reinforcement learning is best when applied to sequential decision-making problems.

One of the most promising enterprise applications of reinforcement learning is customer engagement and determining the next best action. That next best action could be a product recommendation, an offer of a discount, or some messaging on relevant product or brand information. The action could be delivered on one of many different channels (phone call, email, text, posted mail) and at specific times during the day. The critical thing is that the action is personalized based on the customer’s interests, needs and preferences. This is very different from traditional approaches of mass communication and product-centric campaigns.

Machine learning models can predict what products a customer is most likely to buy, what coupons they may redeem or what channel a customer is most likely to respond to.

We need to define what is the state of the agent (for now we can assume there is an agent for each customer); this may include what the customer has purchased in the past, what offers they have seen before, what communications they have engaged with, demographics, and even other model outputs that might capture their needs and preferences. The actions can then include all the combinations of products, offers and messaging across all the different channels. The communications themselves can be personalized to include wording, images, colors and even font sizes. As you can see, the possible state and action pairs is enormous.

For enterprises, having a model that experiments with real customers’ experiences is not a good idea. So being able to learn as much as possible from historical data is important.

>As more companies look to make better and faster decisions that are critical to their business, reinforcement learning will increasingly be used to automate a wider range of business decisions.
