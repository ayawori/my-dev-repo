### BI Analyst

1. Describe the different parts of an SQL query.

2. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?

3. You have a table called with Cust_ID, Order_Date, Order_ID, Tran_Amt. How would
you select the top 100 customers with the highest spend over a year long period?

4. If you were stuck on a desert island with a database that contained all the
knowledge ever created, but you only had 10 SQL statements that you could ever
use, what would they be?

5. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE? What is the difference
between UNION and UNION ALL? What is the difference between a WHERE
statement and a HAVING clause?

6. The conversion rate for a specific chair is 0.5% for the first 50,000 shoppers that look
at it. The price of the chair is $250. Our company makes 27% profit on the sale. The
next 50,000 shoppers will get a 10% discount. What is the conversion rate we must
achieve to receive the same profits as before?

7. What experience do you have with Tableau? Our BI team is brand new and is
under-financed. We have no standard procedures or training and everything
is ad-hoc. How would you go about this situation?

8. You get X amount of views on a website, Y amount of people click on the ad,
then Z amount of people enter their names after, where X, Y and Z are given.
How much does it cost to acquire a customer? What’s the conversion rate?
Would it make sense to run the campaign comparing the value of customer
acquisition to the revenue gained from conversion rate?

9. You have been asked to send an e-mail campaign to customers that have
made a purchase on Amazon.com in the past but not recently. How you
would go about the process. What query would you use?

10. Our firm is going to send 2 different catalogs to their customers. One of the
catalogs costs 50 cents to make and is 50 pages long. The conversion rate for
the catalog is 5% and each customer brings in 315 dollars. The second catalog
costs 95 cents to make, is 100 pages long and each customer brings in 300
dollars from it. The profit margin is 30%. What should the conversion rate for
the second catalog be to make at least the same amount of profit as the first
one. After you find the conversion rate for the second one, there is a second
part of the problem. Wayfair is planning to make a new catalog which is going
to cost 10 cents more than the 100 page one. The more expensive catalog is
going to be sent out to 20% of the customers while the remaining 80% are
going to get the 100 page one. Assume the same 30% profit margin and $300
profit from each customer. What should the conversion rate for the new
catalog be in order to receive the same profit at the end?

### Data Analyst

1. If you have a 10x10x10 cube, what is the outside surface area?

others. Using a digital scale, how would you figure out which one is it with
just one weighting?

3. What is the sum of numbers from 1 to 100?

4. A snail falls down a well 50ft deep. Each day it climbs up 3ft and each night
falls down 1ft. How many days does it take him to get out?

5. How many SUV’s in the parking lot downstairs?

6. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL? What is the
difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE? How would you find median
value for a given columns?

7. Identify the issues in this excel spreadsheet.

8. What kind of RDBMS software do you have experience with?

9. Draw a line that would give our company the same revenue $9 per sale, with
the y-axis (% On Time), and the x-axis ($ off for being late).

10. If a product costs $4.00, with a $800 sunk cost, and we charge X amount of
dollars along with a $10 annual fee, how many do we need to sell to break
even, etc)?

11. Sales department increased the selling price of all items by 5%. There are 10
items, all with different price tags. Before the price increase, gross revenue
was $500,000 with an average selling price of $1. After the price increase
Gross revenue was $505,000, with an average selling price of $0.95. Why
hasn't the price increase had the desired impact of increasing revenue and
average selling price?

#### Mathematics

• What is the sum of numbers from 1 to 100?

• A snail falls down a well 50ft deep. Each day it climbs up 3ft, and each night slides down 1ft. How many days does it take him to get out?

• You have a 10x10x10 cube, made of one thousand 1x1x1 cubes. If you remove the outer
layer of this structure, how many cubes will you have left?

• A race track has 5 lanes. There are 25 horses and one would like to find out the 3 fastest horses of those 25. What is the minimum number of races one would need to conduct to determine the 3 fastest horses?

• Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. Unfortunately, they have a single torch and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without one. The bridge is only strong enough to support two people at a time. Not all people take the same time to cross the bridge. Times for each person: 1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins and 10 mins.
