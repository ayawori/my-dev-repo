[Get ready for digital transformation, says Obama's former big data advisor](http://www.infrastructure-intelligence.com/article/sep-2019/get-ready-digital-transformation-says-former-obama-big-data-advisor)

Stephen Brobst is Teradata CTO. 

> Companies who fail to embrace the digital revolution will cease to exist


```
fail to embrace - no adopten
will case to    - dejarán de
```

>There are three choices in the new economy. Companies are either 
> 1. already data companies 
> 2. will become data companies or 
> 3. will cease to exist. All are data companies

>People talk about the internet of things but I don’t use that term. What we have is the internet of everything! Super technology sensor data can now be supplied for less than the cost of a jellybean. Sensor technology will change everything.

> Infrastructure will be able to self-measure and monitor usage characteristics, environmental conditions, and performance, so as to provide critical data to manufacturers, service organisations and customers alike


```
will be able - podrá
so as to - a fin de
```

>People that are comfortable with digital technologies and using applications tend to be natural learners. When I hire someone, I don’t hire skill sets, I hire people who are inherently curious and have an appetite to learn, and these can be older or younger people. You want to hire people who are open to evolution, open to learning and who are open to change regardless of their age.


```
hire        - contratar
inherently  - intrínsecamente
regardless  - independientemente
```

>Engineers who’ve been around for a while have seen a lot of things and already been through change. They're the survivors, if you will, and if you lose them, you lose a lot of the experience of ‘we’ve tried that and here’s what we learned from that'. If you get a whole bunch of newbie engineers, they’re going to make the same mistakes the experienced guys have already made, so you don’t want to lose that experience

```
who’ve been around  - que han estado presentes
for a while         - por un tiempo
already been        - ya han pasado
```
