### Data Science Experience - Python

In this session we take a real-world use case and implement an analytic workflow using Teradata Vantage. We’ll be using native analytic function from Vantage’s SQL, Machine Learning, and Graph Engines to ingest structured and unstructured data, prepare the data for analytics, and apply data science algorithms to create a predictive model and score the model while creating a visualization App in Teradata Vantage and a BI tool. A sample set of analytic functions will include path analysis, sentiment extraction, machine learning models such as Naïve Bayes or K-Means and others. All analytic function implementations will be done using a combination of Python and drag and drop interfaces. We’ll be working within a Python IDE (think Jupyter Notebooks). 

### Teradata Developer Certification Express Overview

Topics include time indexing, MAPS and analytic functions, and complex SQL functions.
